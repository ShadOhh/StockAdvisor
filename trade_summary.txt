Final Investment Plan:
Given that you have $100,000 in cash and no current holdings or open orders, and considering the slightly positive sentiment and favorable macroeconomic conditions, it might be a good opportunity to invest in stocks that align with these conditions. However, since the selected stocks have shown negative performance recently, it would be prudent to diversify your investments to mitigate risk.

- Consider allocating $50,000 to a diversified set of stocks that are expected to benefit from stable interest rates and decreasing inflation. This could include sectors like technology, consumer goods, or healthcare.
- Keep $50,000 in cash to maintain liquidity and flexibility, allowing you to take advantage of future opportunities or to hedge against potential risks.

This balanced approach allows you to participate in the market while managing risk and maintaining the ability to adapt to changing conditions.
